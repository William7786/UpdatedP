During my time at ECU, I have had the opportunity to explore what leadership means to me. I was able to expand my knowledge by contributing to multiple teams and authoring countless reports on Contemporary Strategy Management that show my knowledge of the business world. I have had experience before this achievement. My first leadership experience was managing groups of volunteers at the Wilson County fair and whirligig. This experience taught me the basics of leadership. I have also gained a multitude of social skills and conducted multiple political campaigns for Susan Martin and Ken Fontenot. Each of these experiences gave me the drive to continue Leading. I am an adaptive learner and like to experience new aspects of business and technology. I have explored the world of full-stack development at UNC-Chapel Hill where I have constructed multiple front-end and back-end applications and websites. This Bootcamp Consisted of a 24-Week program with an added 240 hours for projects that have expanded my knowledge of web development. I learned to use critical thinking to design websites and fix errors. This course grew my ability to contribute to teams through GitHub and most importantly I have learned to be an effective and efficient member of a digital team. Currently, I am exploring the Digital marketing world with NC State. This Digital Marketing Bootcamp has continued to improve my leadership and public speaking skills. I have been a part of a mock digital marketing agency throughout the course of the program named “Real World Marketing” where we have constructed social media marketing strategies, competitive analysis, and content calendars for a client provided by NC State. Within this course, I have also grown my knowledge of WordPress by creating multiple websites that have allowed me to explore digital marketing in a new light. Each website I have created has been optimized for SEO and has used a variety of WordPress Plugins. Overall, this course has taught me not just how to work in a team but to act and not be afraid of failure when working towards success.
